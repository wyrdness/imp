## Overview

An imp is a small supernatural creature from European folklore with a dual nature depending on tradition. In demonic tradition, imps are minor demons or devil's servants, often serving witches and sorcerers as familiar spirits, typically depicted with tails, horns, and sometimes wings. In fairy tradition, imps are mischievous sprites or tricksters causing minor chaos and pranks.

Standing 6 inches to 2 feet tall, imps possess powers including shape-shifting, invisibility, minor magic, and flight. Medieval demonology strongly associated imps with witchcraft, where a witch's familiar was often called an imp. The term "impish" derives from their mischievous behavior.

In modern fantasy (D&D, video games), imps represent a standard lesser demon or mischievous creature type.
